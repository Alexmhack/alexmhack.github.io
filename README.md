Users can also send game invitations to other users in the database, for simple usages wewill use the SQlite3 database that comes
preinstalled with django.

### Steps for Django Game

1. Create virtualenv for our django project using the terminal, if you don't have virtaulenv
	installed then install it using the pip command

our virtual environment will be saved
